# Voltage-insights-dashboard

About:
This project is  for analyzing voltage time series data. It includes interactive visualizations, moving average smoothing, peak and low detection, and slope acceleration analysis. Designed to demonstrate practical data manipulation and hosting skills using Python.

Features:
List of key functionalities:
- Upload CSV file with Timestamp and Values
- Plot original and smoothed voltage data
- 5-point and 100-point moving averages
- Detect local peaks and lows
- Identify voltage drops below 20
- Bonus: Detect accelerating downward slopes
- Hosted using Streamlit Cloud

File Structure
